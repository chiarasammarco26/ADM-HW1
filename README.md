Problem 1: In the file "Problem 1" there are the challenges required to do for Problem 1 in the homework. I did almost all of them without checking the Discussion pages, but for the Regex and Parsing exercises I didn't know where to start so most of them are very similar. Some exercises are missing (mostly Medium or Hard challenges) since I couldn't do them by myself. Also there are some codes that don't work for all tests but I added them to get some points anyway.

Problem 2: In the file "Problem 2" there are all the challenges required to do Problem 2. I did all of them, there's nothing to say about these.

PDF SUBMISSIONS: This is the PDF with all the screenshots of the submissions. As you can tell, there's an exercise from "Itertools" I did by mistake.
